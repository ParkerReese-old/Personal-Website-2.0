      So! You want to know a little bit about me? Well, my name is Parker Reese and I am currently Interning as a Software Developer
      at Vendasta. I have completed three years of my Computer Science degree and am looking forward to getting that very
      expensive piece of paper with my name on it. I love to do all the usual things such as Netflix, video games, archery
      dodgeball, and tagging friends in memes. I also love to do many unusual things such as putting ketchup on my mac-n-cheese,
      putting pineapple on my pizza, and using the signal light when I drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to have the life goal of working with new and exciting technologies amongst a team of developers. Since I am
      accomplishing that goal every day with my internship, Iâ€™ve decided to take on a new goal: make as much money as possible
      while sitting at home, on my computer, in my underwear. This is, in my opinion, the highest form of success known to
      humankind.
    </p>
