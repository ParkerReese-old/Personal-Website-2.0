        So! You want to know a little bit about me? Well, my name is Parker Reese and I am currently Interning as a Software Developer
        at Vendasta. I have completed three years of my Computer Science degree and am looking forward to getting that very
        expensive piece of paper with my name on it. I love to do all the usual things such as Netflix, video games, archery
        dodgeball, and tagging friends in memes. I also love to do many unusual things such as putting ketchup on my mac-n-cheese,
        putting pineapple on my pizza, and using the signal light when I drive.
      </p>
      <p class="goal-paragraph">
        I used to have the life goal of working on a new and exciting technology amongst a team of skilled developers. Since I am
        accomplishing that goal every day with my Internship; Iâ€™ve decided to take on a new goal: make as much money as possible
        while sitting at home, on my computer, in my underwear. This is, in my opinion, the highest form of success known
        to humankind.
